# RESCAT — Project Instructions

RESCAT is a Too Good To Go-style two-sided marketplace for Guayaquil, Ecuador: neighborhood stores publish "cajas sorpresa" (surprise boxes) of near-expiry groceries at a discount; customers ("Rescatistas") discover them by proximity, reserve in-app, pay cash-on-pickup (or a mocked card), get a pickup code, and review after pickup. Stage: MVP / functional demo (Rebanada 1).

## Conventions (hard rules)
- Code in **English**. **NO comments** in any file.
- **camelCase** for code file names (e.g. `boxCard.tsx`, `reservationCode.ts`). Next.js route files stay framework-lowercase (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `[id]`).
- **UI copy and domain data in Spanish** (customers are Ecuadorian) — never translate product names/categories.
- DB columns are **camelCase, quoted in SQL** (e.g. `"stockQty"`); tables/enums lowercase.
- Design tokens "Cosecha": cream `#F6EFDD`, pino `#123B29`, hoja `#5E8A31`, dorado `#E5A11C`, terracota `#CE5228` (terracota/red = urgency only). Fonts: Fraunces (display) + Hanken Grotesk (body). Buyer is called "Rescatista".

## Stack
Next.js 16 (App Router, TypeScript) · Tailwind v4 (CSS-first; bridged to `tailwind.config.ts` via `@config` in `app/globals.css`) · shadcn/ui (**Base UI** preset — import from `@/components/ui/*`) · Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage + RLS) · Leaflet + OpenStreetMap (client-only, `dynamic(ssr:false)`) · Vitest + Playwright.

## Architecture & rules
- Reads via **Server Components**; mutations via **Server Actions** in `actions/`.
- **Reservations are created ONLY via the `reserve_box` Postgres RPC** (atomic `FOR UPDATE` stock decrement + `auth.uid() = p_customer_id` identity guard + pickup-window check). Never insert into `reservation` directly — there is no INSERT policy on purpose.
- **RLS is the authorization boundary.** Server actions use the user-session client (`lib/supabase/server.ts`), never the service_role key. service_role is only for seed / tests / cron.
- Roles: `customer` (Google + email/password) and `merchant` (email/password; `/merchant/*` gated by `middleware.ts` + `profile.role`). No self-serve merchant signup (concierge; role set via dashboard/service_role). `profile.role` is not client-writable. Admin = Supabase dashboard, no custom UI.
- Payment: `lib/payment.ts` with `cashOnPickup` (default, real) and `cardMock` (simulated). No real gateway.
- Discovery: `list_boxes_near(lat,lng)` RPC (haversine; filters active + stock>0 + pickupEnd>now) + browser Geolocation (fallback to Guayaquil center).

## DB / infra (critical for any DB work)
- **The direct DB host is IPv6-only and this environment has no IPv6 → use the SESSION POOLER.** The connection string is in `.env.local` as `SUPABASE_DB_URL` (`aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432`).
- Apply migrations with psql: `set -a; . ./.env.local; set +a` then `psql "$SUPABASE_DB_URL" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f supabase/migrations/NNNN.sql`. **Do NOT use `supabase link` / `db push`** (no access token available).
- **`supabase gen types` needs Docker (unavailable here) → hand-author `lib/database.types.ts`** to match the schema exactly (tables/enums + a `Functions` block for the RPCs).
- Migrations are **append-only** in `supabase/migrations/` (0001–0006 applied). Storage bucket `box-photos` is public.

## Commands
- `npm run dev` — dev server (http://localhost:3000)
- `npm run build` · `npx tsc --noEmit`
- `npm test` — Vitest (geo, payment, reserveBox concurrency, RLS; some hit the live DB and create test rows)
- `npx playwright test` — E2E customer reserve happy path
- `npx tsx supabase/seed.ts` — seed (NOT idempotent for auth users; run once on a fresh DB)

## Demo accounts (seeded)
- Customer: `cliente@rescat.ec` / `rescat123` (or "Continuar con Google")
- Merchant: `tienda@rescat.ec` / `rescat123` (email/password only) → `/merchant`

## Repo
GitHub `SebasB76/RESCAT` (private). Branches: `master` (default) + `feat/slice1`. The old prototype is kept under `legacy/` for reference only.

## Status / deferred
- Google OAuth: configured and working.
- Deferred: Vercel deploy (not online yet); the cron `.github/workflows/cron.yml` needs GitHub repo secrets to run; real payment gateway (EC: PayPhone/Kushki) — mock only; WhatsApp notifications — beyond MVP.
- Known: Next 16 warns that `middleware` is being renamed to `proxy` (still works). Design spec and implementation plan live in `docs/superpowers/`.

## Secrets
`.env.local` is gitignored — never commit it. The service_role key and DB password were shared in chat during setup; rotate them before any real production use.
